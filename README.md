# Junkyard

A random collection of things I've saved for archive.

One man's trash is another man's treasure.

Initial setup based on: https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/dockerizing-a-ruby-on-rails-application

Use Minio as the local object store (make sure files are saved into a specific directory under Dropbox)
https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-client-complete-guide

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
